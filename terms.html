We also enable you to add or generate your own content by interacting with other users (" User Generated Content"). When using our Services, it is important that you respect locations, intellectual property rights, privacy and the rights of third parties at all times.

                            All provisions that are intended to survive the termination, by nature or because such has expressly been provided for in these T&C or any agreement with you, shall survive such termination.

                            If any provision of the T&C is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be construed to reflect the parties' original intent. Despite the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision, all other provisions will remain in full force and effect.
